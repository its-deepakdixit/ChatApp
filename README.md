# Facebook Clone 
A simple, responsive Facebook Clone made using Typescript and React. 

Currently, I have implemented the feed update feature only, along with a widget. 

Deployed it using vercel [here](https://fb-clone-ayushiee.vercel.app).

Please leave a ‚≠ê as motivation if you liked the implementation
